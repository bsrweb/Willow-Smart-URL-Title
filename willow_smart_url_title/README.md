# Willow's Smart URL Titles for ExpressionEngine 3 & 4

This addon will check for an existing URL Title in the same channel and automatically append it to avoid errors when saving the entry. 

Example, if an existing URL title *willow-smart-url-title* exists, the addon will change it to *willow-smart-url-title-2*. It will also increment the number (up to 10) if future entries share the same URL title.

Additionally a message will be displayed under the URL Title field to let the editor know that a duplicate URL was found, and the URL Title was modified to avoid errors.

##Requirements

ExpressionEngine 3.0 and above is required.

##Installation

Just copy the willow_smart_url_titles folder to your **/user/addons** folder and activate it in the CPanel.
